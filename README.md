Overview:
RentRise.io is an engaging and insightful web application that visualizes rent rise in New York City through interactive maps and graphs. The application focuses on providing a comprehensive view of neighborhood transformations, driven by data and accessible visualization techniques.

In this project, I designed a responsive and user-friendly interface using React, ensuring optimal accessibility and user engagement on various devices. The core of RentRise.io lies in its dynamic visualizations, achieved through the integration of recharts.js and leaflet.js. These tools enabled me to present complex data in an interactive and easily understandable format, enhancing the user experience and providing clear insights into the trends of neighborhood rent rise.

Furthermore, I incorporated real-time data from StreetEasy, enriching the application with accurate and comprehensive insights into neighborhood rent rises. This integration allows users to explore and understand the evolving landscape of New York City's neighborhoods, making RentRise.io not just a tool for visualization but also a platform for informed analysis.
